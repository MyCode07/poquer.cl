                        First, ensure that the wagering sites have a valid license issued by relevant authorities. Look
                        for important things
                        like their privacy policy and their commitment to responsible gambling. Factor in the available
                        banking methods, games
                        such as slots, and how an operator treats its customers.</p>

                    <p>Online betting laws in the Philippine islands are very strict, especially when it comes to
                        offering gambling and casino
                        services within the country’s borders. Locally licensed sites can’t and don’t offer their
                        services to Filipinos. But
                        according to online gambling laws, it’s not punishable for one to participate in online betting
                        as long as he or she
                        does so at licensed offshore gambling sites.</p>
                    <p>However, technology has enabled people to engage in sports betting at different venues or
                        platforms. With VPNs, it’s now
                        possible to engage in gambling at different agencies. VPNs mask the identity of people, enabling
                        them to place real bets
                        regardless of age. </p>

                    <p>At first glance, laws relating to gambling in the PH can be counterintuitive and appear difficult
                        to understand. But as
                        mentioned earlier, two regulatory bodies –PAGCOR and the Cagayan Economic Zone Authority – are
                        tasked with issuing
                        licenses to operators. However, PAGCOR is the government agency that issues licenses to
                        brick-and-mortar casinos, while
                        CEZA, another body formed by the government, issues licenses to online operators.</p>

                    <p>Almost all sites that accept Filipinos offer welcome bonuses and other enticing promotions,
                        primarily to attract new
                        players. It’s important to note, though, that welcome bonuses differ from one casino to the

                        steer clear away from
                        include the likes of Betport Casino, Blu Casino, Balzac Casino, Aztec Casino, and Amco Casino.
                        Don’t try betting here
                        since a majority have payment problems, other operators spam players, and some have been

                    <p>An interesting custom you will find in the Philippines is wagering during funeral events, a
                        tradition considered to
                        honor the dead. Such could be in the form of mahjong or sakla. Even the kids can engage in the
                        fun, and place fighting
                        spiders bets to experience the feel of how gambling can be. Besides spiders wrestling, chances
                        are that you will find
                        horse fighting and other blood sports throughout the day. Most gambling proceeds and any other
                        revenue go to the
                        deceased family and don’t get taxed.</p>
